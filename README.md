How to get Started:

What did i Use?
- IntelliJ Ultimate Edition
- Java JDK 1.6 (I had to use JDK 1.6 otherwise i would get an exception error)
- UISpec4J 2.4
- Gradle 3.2.1
- Cucumber-java 1.2.5
- Cucumber-junit 1.2.5
- Cucumber-weld 1.2.5
- Junit 4.12
- assertj-swing-testng 3.5.0
- assertj-swing-junit 3.5.0

This demo swing application is an example on how to use Cucumber + UISpec4J
Also I have included an example on how to use Cucumber in combination with AssertJ. AssertJ is a fork from FEST (which is discontinued but the fork is being updated occasionally)

Run the example CucumberRunnerUIspec4j or CucumberRunnerAssertJ as a JUnitTest and you will see it testing the demoApp.
Make sure to set the Java version to 1.6 otherwise it won't work.

NOTE: There is a way to run it in Java 7 and 8 but you will need to use 2.5-SNAPSHOT. there is no release version of this...however AssertJ works in Java 8 out of the box.


If anyone has suggestions to use other frameworks that work with Java Swing.
drop me an email cheung.kayip1@gmail.com
