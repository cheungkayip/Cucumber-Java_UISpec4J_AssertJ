How to get Started:

What did i Use?
- IntelliJ Ultimate Edition
- Java JDK 1.6 (I had to use JDK 1.6 otherwise i would get an exception error)
- UISpec4J 2.4
- Gradle 3.2.1
- Cucumber-java 1.2.5
- Cucumber-junit 1.2.5
- Cucumber-weld 1.2.5
- Junit 4.12

This demo swing application is an example on how to use Cucumber + UISpec4J

Run the example CucumberRunnerUIspec4j as a JUnitTest and you will see it testing the demoApp.
Make sure to set the Java version to 1.6 otherwise it won't work.
I Am still figuring out a way to run it on 1.8. 

If anyone has suggestions to use other frameworks that work with 1.8 (Instead of UISpecTestCase)
drop me an email cheung.kayip1@gmail.com
